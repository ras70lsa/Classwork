\textbf{Problem 1A}

Prove that if there is a solution it is at most 2m-1.

Proof by contradiction.

Assume (towards contradiction) that there is a solution $A$ of $n$ potions such that the amount of healing is $2m-1$. Let $S$ be the array of the amount of healing associated with each potion in the solution set. In other words let $s$ be the array [$w_1$...$w_n$] where $w_k$ corresponds to the $k^{\text{th}}$ potion used to heal the Pokemon.

Let $a[i]$ be the sum of values in $s$ for index 0 to $i$ in $s$. By the assumption made about $A$ it must follow that $a[n] = 2m - 1$.

Additionally, given the constraint of the problem (i.e. the healing power for all potions must be less than m), $1 < S[n] < m$. Therefore:
$$m \leq a[n-1] \leq 2m-2$$

This shows for any valid value of $S[n]$ there exists a solution $B$ of $n-1$ potions such that the amount of healing is between $m$ and $2m-2$. Any of the possible values for this solution $B$ are both valid (have healing power $\geq m$) and has lower healing power than $A$. Since all valid solutions must minimize the total healing power and solution $B$ exists with healing power less than $A$, $A$ must not be a valid solution. Thus, by contradiction $A$ cannot be a valid solution and the healing $2m-1$ cannot exist as a solution.

It can easily be seen that there is a solution that has total healing power equal to $2m-2$. This is shown below:

\begin{center}
m = 4  Available potions = [3, 3]

The only valid solution is S = \{3,3\}

This solution has total healing value, $h$, satisfying $h = 6 = 2 * (4) - 2 = 2m -2$
\end{center}

Since all potions have integer healing values it must hold true that $2m-2$ is the upper bound for valid solutions


\noindent
\textbf{Problem 1B}

Let $p$ be the list of available potions. If we consider the $i^{\text{th}}$ potion in $p$ we can either chose to include in our summation of values from 0 to $i$ or not.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{(not include $i$)}.
  \item \textit{(include $i$)}.
\end{itemize}

We can produce the value $j$ if \textit{either} of these above cases is correct. Therefore:

\begin{centerverbatim}
a[i,j] = a[i-1, j] || a[i-1, j-p[i]]
\end{centerverbatim}

\textit{Base Cases: }

\begin{centerverbatim}
a[i,0] = 0 for 0 < i < n
\end{centerverbatim}
